PROJECT SUMMARY
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The purpose of this project was to get familiar with the HTML5 and CSS web programming by creating a static grocery store website.

Home Page
---------
The name chosen for the grocery store is Grocery Store Online (GSO), and the design of the whole project was inspired by many examples of grocery store websites like IGA, Metro, and Super C. The navigation bar on top of each page gives a professional esthetic to the website and allows the user to navigate through it easily. The home page gives the choice to the user whether to access different aisles with the navigation bar or with representative images found under the header of the page. Below are included some examples of weekly deals that give direct access to each product presented. Then, like with any other grocery store website, the user can enter his personal email to suscribe to weekly deals notifications. The footer of the page is the same for all pages of the website, and in there, the user can find a link to the backstore part of GSO, the team members' names who worked on this project, and some static elements to complete the look of the page.

Aisle/Product Pages
-------------------
The aisle pages present four products of particular type each, and link these products to their own page with a small summary (weight, price, name). Buttons to add the product to the cart are available to the user as well, and another link which would normally give the user a description of the product is found just below. Other related products are presented at the bottom of the page and the user can access each on of them with a siple click on the image.

Sign In/Sign Up Pages
---------------------
In the navigation bar, there is a section that says "Account" which has two links: one to the sign in page and the other to the sign up page. On the sign in page, the user can enter his username (email) and his password before logging in with the "Sign In" button. The functionality "Show Password" is available to the user as well if he wants to make sure he made no mistake in there. A link for the forgot password is placed under the button, but it is not linked to any other page at the moment. The sign up page, on the other hand, asks the user to enter all his personal information necessary to create his account which could be stored on a server later. Textfields for the name, the password, the email, and the postal code as well as the radio type input for gender can be found there. The user has to check the box saying that he agrees to the terms of service of GSO, and "Terms of Service" is directly linked to a page with generic conditions of use. The buttons "Reset" and "Submit" are placed at the bottom of the form.
